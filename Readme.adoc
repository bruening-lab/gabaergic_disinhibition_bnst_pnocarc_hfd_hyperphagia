## Overview

This repository contains the calcium imaging data analysis and figures for the paper titled "GABAergic disinhibition from the BNST to PNOCARC neurons promotes HFD-induced hyperphagia".

## Reproduce the Results

### Prerequisites

- R version 4.3.1
- Docker (optional)
- Singularity (optional for HPC environments)

### Steps

1. **Environment Setup**: To ensure reproducibility, it is recommended to use the `renv` environment provided in this repository. This ensures that all necessary R packages and their specific versions are installed.

2. **Using Docker**: For those preferring Docker, the `mytidyverse-4.3.1-2` Docker container is available. It contains all the required dependencies pre-installed. Pull the Docker image using the following command: `docker pull paulklemm/mytidyverse:4.3.1-2`. You can then run the container locally or use it in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment with Singularity.

3. **Update project path**: Make sure you update the `root` path in `analysis/pnoc/_targets.R` to the path where the repository is located on your system.

4. **Running the Analysis**: To reproduce the results, execute the plots.Rmd R Markdown file. This file contains all the necessary code to generate the figures and results presented in the paper.
If you are using the makefile for automation, ensure to adjust the run command according to your setup (local, Docker, or Singularity).
